# Temperature-converter
* This is the first website I have created as a task of my internship.
* Created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* A simple tool that allows users to convert temperatures between different scales, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
* The basic function of the website is to enter the input for a temperature scale and see the equivalent value of other scales simultaneously.
